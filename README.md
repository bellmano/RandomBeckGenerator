A website that helps you choose a random Beck movie to watch. Perfect for when you can't decide which Beck film to enjoy!

## :scroll: Introduction

Beck is a long-running Swedish film series following detective Martin Beck through decades of classic Scandinavian crime stories. Over the years, it has become somewhat of a cult phenomenon, loved for its mix of crime, humor, and iconic characters.

The idea for this project came from the podcast TuttoBalutto, where the hosts jokingly suggested picking a random Beck movie to watch. I decided to make that joke a reality.

## :sparkles: Features

- A random number generator tailored for Beck films
- Lightweight website deployed though GitHub pages with a custom domain
- A scheduled IMDb rating fetcher that runs every Monday night to get correct IMDb ratings for each film

## :test_tube: Running Tests

To run the tests and view coverage:

1. Install the required dev dependency:
	```powershell
	npm install
	```
2. Run the test coverage script:
	```powershell
	npm run test:coverage
	```

This will execute the tests and generate a coverage report.
